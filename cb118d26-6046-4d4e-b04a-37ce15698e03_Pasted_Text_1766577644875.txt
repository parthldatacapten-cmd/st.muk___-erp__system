NAAC, accounts, faculty, principal all covered

This is a solid, realistic build plan.

🔜 NEXT OPTIONAL STEP

If you want, next we can:

👉 Create a high-level database schema

👉 Create a Laravel module folder structure

👉 Create a 3-month delivery roadmap

Tell me what you want next.

we need larvel module as well database scheme ,
but i want to know which documets we need for this , like PRD and all 

Excellent question — this is exactly the right moment to ask this.
Before touching Laravel modules or DB schemas, you must lock the right documents, otherwise the team will drift.

Below is a clear, industry-grade document stack tailored specifically for your PVGS system (not generic SaaS).

I’ll explain:
1️⃣ What documents you need
2️⃣ Which ones are mandatory vs optional
3️⃣ What each document should contain (PVGS-specific)
4️⃣ The correct order to create them
5️⃣ When to start Laravel modules & DB schema

📄 DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR PVGS SYSTEM
1️⃣ PRD — Product Requirements Document (MANDATORY)
Purpose

👉 Single source of truth for what is being built and why.

This is the most important document.

PVGS PRD MUST CONTAIN
A. Background & Objectives

Why old system failed

Goals of new PVGS system

Constraints (no mobile app, no online exams, independent system)

B. Stakeholders

Principal (Observer)

HOD

Faculty

Accounts

Students

Super Admin

C. In-Scope (Phase 1)

All Phase 1 modules we finalized

Explicitly list them

D. Out-of-Scope

Mobile app

QR / biometric attendance

Online exams

E. User Personas

Principal (Observer)

Faculty (Daily user)

Accounts (Transactional)

Student (Self-service)

F. Success Metrics

Attendance adoption %

Fee payment clarity

NAAC reporting time reduction

🔒 Without this PRD, dev scope will explode.

2️⃣ FRD — Functional Requirements Document (MANDATORY)
Purpose

👉 Defines exact behavior of each feature.

PRD = what
FRD = how it works

PVGS FRD STRUCTURE (IMPORTANT)

For each module, include:

Example: Attendance Module

Who can mark attendance?

When can it be edited?

What happens on holiday?

What reports exist?

Repeat this for:

Fees

Admission

Lesson planning

Results

Roles & permissions

🔒 This prevents future arguments like:

“We assumed it would work like this”

3️⃣ RBAC DOCUMENT — Roles & Permissions Matrix (MANDATORY)
Purpose

👉 Prevents data leaks & confusion.

Must Include

A matrix like:

Feature	Super Admin	Principal	HOD	Faculty	Student
View attendance	✅	✅	✅	Own	Own
Edit attendance	❌	❌	❌	✅	❌
View fees	✅	✅	❌	❌	Own

This becomes:

Laravel Policies

Middleware rules

🔒 This document saves weeks of rework.

4️⃣ DATA MODEL DOCUMENT (ERD) (MANDATORY BEFORE DB)
Purpose

👉 Visual understanding of data relationships.

Must Include

Programs → Units → Subjects → Components

Students → Attendance → Results

Fees → Installments → Payments

Users → Roles → Permissions

This does NOT include SQL yet.

🔒 Once ERD is approved, DB schema becomes straightforward.

5️⃣ WORKFLOW DIAGRAMS (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
Purpose

👉 Shows real-life flow, not tables.

Must Include (At least these 5)

Student admission flow

Fee payment (installment enforcement)

Attendance marking

Lesson plan approval

Result generation

Simple diagrams are enough (even draw.io).

6️⃣ UI WIREFRAMES / SCREEN LIST (RECOMMENDED)
Purpose

👉 Avoids “we thought this screen existed” issues.

You don’t need full designs.

Just:

Screen name

Role

Core actions

7️⃣ API / INTEGRATION DOCUMENT (OPTIONAL for Phase 1)

Only needed if:

Payment gateway

SMS / Email

Future ERP sync

Can be lightweight for now.

🧠 DOCUMENT PRIORITY (VERY IMPORTANT)
MUST HAVE (DO NOT SKIP)

1️⃣ PRD
2️⃣ FRD
3️⃣ RBAC Matrix
4️⃣ ERD

NICE TO HAVE

5️⃣ Workflow diagrams
6️⃣ Wireframes

🛣️ CORRECT ORDER TO PROCEED

Follow this exact sequence:

1️⃣ Finalize PRD
2️⃣ Write FRD module by module
3️⃣ Lock Roles & Permissions matrix
4️⃣ Design ERD
5️⃣ THEN create:

Laravel modules

Database schema

Migrations

If you reverse this order, you’ll redo work.

🧩 HOW THIS MAPS TO LARAVEL
Document	Laravel Impact
PRD	Scope & sprint planning
FRD	Controllers & services
RBAC	Policies & middleware
ERD	Migrations & models
🔜 NEXT STEP (RECOMMENDED)

I suggest we start with PRD and build it together, tailored exactly to PVGS.

👉 Say “Create PVGS PRD outline”
and I’ll give you a ready-to-fill PRD structure you can share internally.

lets start with PRD 

Perfect.
We’ll do this properly and practically, so this PRD can be:

Shared with PVGS decision-makers

Used by your Laravel team

Act as a scope-lock document (no future confusion)

Below is a PVGS-specific PRD, not a generic template.
You can copy this into a Google Doc / Word and treat it as v1.0.

Phase 3: Enhancements (mobile, QR, online exams)

🔒 PRD STATUS

Once this PRD is:

Reviewed internally

Approved by decision makers

👉 NO new features are added to Phase 1 without change approval

This is your scope shield.

🔜 NEXT STEP (VERY IMPORTANT)

Next, we should create the FRD (Functional Requirements Document) module by module, starting with:

👉 Roles & Permissions FRD (most foundational)

OR

👉 Academic Structure FRD (drives everything else)

Tell me which one you want to do next.

lets create FRD 

Perfect.
We’ll now move from “what we want” (PRD) to “exactly how it must work” (FRD).

I’ll do this systematically, because FRD is what:

Developers build from

QA tests against

Stakeholders approve feature-by-feature

We will create the FRD in modules, in the correct dependency order.

📘 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (FRD)
PVG’s College of Science & Commerce System
📌 FRD STRUCTURE (HOW WE’LL WRITE IT)

For each module, we will define:

Purpose

Actors (roles involved)

Functional rules

Edge cases & validations

Outputs / reports

This avoids ambiguity.

🔷 MODULE ORDER (IMPORTANT)

We must do FRD in this order:

1️⃣ Academic Structure (foundation)
2️⃣ Roles & Permissions
3️⃣ Users & Staff
4️⃣ Student Admission & Profiles
5️⃣ Fees & Installments
6️⃣ Timetable & Scheduling
7️⃣ Attendance (Student + Staff)
8️⃣ Lesson Planning
9️⃣ Examination & Results
🔟 Reports & NAAC

We start with Module 1 now.

🟦 FRD – MODULE 1: ACADEMIC STRUCTURE
1.1 Purpose

To define and manage all academic entities such as programs, years, semesters, subjects, and components in a flexible and reusable manner.

This module drives:

Attendance

Lesson plans

Fees

Results

Reports

1.2 Actors

Super Admin (full control)

HOD (view only)

Faculty (view only)

1.3 Core Entities (Conceptual)

Program (e.g., B.Sc. Computer Science)

Academic Unit (Year)

Semester

Subject

Subject Offering

Subject Component (Theory/Lab/Project)

1.4 Program Definition
Rules

A Program must have:

Name (e.g., B.Sc. Computer Science)

Level (UG / PG)

Department

Duration (years)

Program structure must be configurable:

Default: 2 semesters per year

Can be overridden per program if needed

Example

B.Sc. Computer Science

Level: UG

Duration: 3 years

Semesters: 6

1.5 Academic Units (Years)
Rules

Each Program has academic units:

FY, SY, TY (UG)

FY, SY (PG)

Academic unit names must be configurable

Units are linked to exactly one Program

1.6 Semesters
Rules

Each Academic Unit contains one or more semesters

Semester properties:

Semester number

Display name

Start & end dates

Subjects are always assigned to semesters (STRICT RULE)

✅ Answering your question

Are subjects strictly semester-based?
👉 YES, but semesters themselves are configurable per program.

1.7 Subject Master
Rules

Subject master is reusable across programs

Subject master contains:

Subject name

Subject type (Core / Elective / Generic)

Subject category (Academic / Skill / Value-added)

Subject master does NOT belong to a program directly

1.8 Subject Offering (VERY IMPORTANT)

This solves your reuse + code confusion problem.

Rules

A Subject Offering is:

Subject + Program + Semester

Subject code is defined at offering level, not master

Why?

Same subject can have:

Different codes (UG vs PG)

Different components

Different credit weight

Example

Subject: Object Oriented Programming

B.Sc. CS → Code: CS-301

M.Sc. CS → Code: CS-601

1.9 Subject Components
Purpose

To handle theory, lab, project, internal, external, etc.

Rules

A subject offering can have multiple components

Each component has:

Component type (Theory / Lab / Project)

Marks allocation

Attendance required (Yes/No)

Components can:

Have separate faculty

Have separate attendance

Have separate marks

✅ Answering your question

Can a subject have multiple components?
👉 YES (mandatory design)

Can components have separate faculty & marks?
👉 YES (mandatory design)

1.10 Faculty Assignment Rules

Faculty is assigned at component level

One faculty can teach multiple components

Same faculty cannot be assigned overlapping timetable slots

System must block scheduling conflicts

1.11 Visibility & Access Control (Academic Data)
Rules

Faculty sees only:

Programs

Subjects

Components assigned to them

Animation faculty must NOT see B.Sc. CS data

HOD sees all data of their department only

Principal sees all (read-only)

1.12 Validations & Constraints

Subject cannot exist without semester

Component marks total must match subject total

Subject code uniqueness enforced per program + semester

Subject offering cannot be deleted if attendance or marks exist

1.13 Outputs

Program structure view

Semester-wise subject list

Faculty workload summary

Subject-component mapping report

🔒 MODULE 1 STATUS

Once approved:

DB structure can be designed

Everything else depends on this

🔜 NEXT MODULE OPTIONS

We should proceed with one of these next:

1️⃣ FRD – Roles & Permissions (security foundation)
2️⃣ FRD – Student Admission & Profile (business-critical)

👉 Tell me which module to do next, and we continue.

1️⃣ FRD – Roles & Permissions (security foundation)
2️⃣ FRD – Student Admission & Profile (business-critical)

Great choice — this is the correct sequence.
We’ll do both modules now, cleanly and in detail, because:

Roles & Permissions decide who sees what (security, compliance)

Student Admission & Profile is the entry point of all data (fees, NAAC, results)

I’ll keep this implementation-ready for Laravel.

🟦 FRD – MODULE 2: ROLES & PERMISSIONS (RBAC)
2.1 Purpose

To ensure strict access control, data isolation between departments/programs, and role-based actions across the PVGS system.

🔜 NEXT MODULE OPTIONS

We should continue with one of these business-critical modules next:

1️⃣ Fees & Installments (high pain area)
2️⃣ Attendance (student + staff)
3️⃣ Lesson Planning (faculty adoption)

👉 Tell me which one to do next.

1️⃣ Fees & Installments (high pain area)
2️⃣ Attendance (student + staff)
3️⃣ Lesson Planning (faculty adoption)

Excellent — these three modules are the heart of PVGS’s real pain.
If we get these right, adoption will happen naturally.

I’ll cover all three FRDs now, but in a crisp, implementation-ready way so your Laravel team can directly work from this.

🟦 FRD – MODULE 4: FEES & INSTALLMENTS

👉 Tell me which one to do next.

1️⃣ Examination & Results FRD
2️⃣ Reports & NAAC FRD

Perfect.
These are the final two core FRD modules, and they close the academic + compliance loop.

I’ll keep this practical, since PVGS:

May not conduct exams online

But must generate results & NAAC data cleanly

🚀 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

You are now ready to build.

Next logical steps (in order):

1️⃣ ERD / Database Schema design
2️⃣ Laravel module breakdown
3️⃣ API & service layer planning
4️⃣ Sprint planning (Phase 1)

🔜 NEXT STEP

👉 Say “Design ERD for PVGS”
and I’ll design the database schema aligned exactly with this FRD.

lets review every doc that we created , check if we have any issues , and then proceed 
ERD / Database Schema design
2️⃣ Laravel module breakdown
3️⃣ API & service layer planning
4️⃣ Sprint planning (Phase 1)

Excellent pause point 👍
This is exactly where most projects fail if they don’t review — you’re doing it right.

I’ll do this in 4 structured parts:

1️⃣ Full document review (PRD + all FRDs)
2️⃣ Identify gaps, risks, and corrections
3️⃣ Confirm design decisions (lock them)
4️⃣ Only then move to:

ERD

Laravel modules

API/services

Phase-1 sprint plan

I’ll be very explicit about what is safe, what needs clarification, and what must be locked now.

1️⃣ DOCUMENT REVIEW SUMMARY
✅ PRD REVIEW (High-level)
What is STRONG

Clear scope (independent system, no ERP integration)

Correct stakeholders identified

Explicit Phase-1 vs Out-of-scope

Real PVGS pain points captured (fees, NAAC, faculty adoption)

No major PRD issues ❗

PRD is solid and realistic.

🔒 PRD status: APPROVED (no changes needed)

✅ FRD REVIEW — MODULE BY MODULE
MODULE 1: Academic Structure ✅
What’s correct

Subject Master vs Subject Offering split ✅

Semester-strict subject assignment ✅

Component-level faculty & marks ✅

Program-scoped visibility (Animation vs CS) ✅

⚠️ Potential Risk (needs explicit decision)

Academic Pattern Variability

You asked:

“Do all programs strictly follow 2 semesters per year?”

Recommendation (LOCK THIS)

System supports flexible semesters

Default = 2 semesters per year

Override allowed only by Super Admin

🔒 Decision: APPROVE with this rule

MODULE 2: Roles & Permissions ✅
What’s correct

Observer-style Principal role (very good)

Department isolation

Assignment-based faculty access

Audit logs for sensitive actions

⚠️ One Missing Clarification

Who can create custom roles?

👉 Recommendation:

Only Super Admin

Custom roles must be mapped to modules

🔒 No design change required, just documentation clarity

MODULE 3: Student Admission & Profile ✅
What’s correct

Online admission flow

Editable profile fields with approval

Category & NAAC alignment

Strong audit trail

⚠️ Minor Gap

Re-admission / year promotion

Currently:

Covered as “Phase 2” (good)

🔒 Explicitly lock:

Phase 1 = manual promotion only

This avoids complexity now.

MODULE 4: Fees & Installments ⚠️ (MOST IMPORTANT REVIEW)
What’s EXCELLENT

Installment sequence enforcement (this fixes PVGS’s biggest pain)

Scholarships as adjustments (correct design)

Installment-wise reports

No deletion of paid records

⚠️ CRITICAL EDGE CASE (must address now)
Scenario:

Student pays installment 1

Scholarship approved later

👉 Decision needed:

Does scholarship refund?

Or adjust future installments?

Recommendation (industry-standard):

Scholarships adjust future dues only

No automatic refunds

Manual refund only via Accounts (logged)

🔒 This must be locked before ERD

MODULE 5: Attendance (Student + Staff) ✅
What’s correct

Timetable-linked attendance

Edit windows with audit

Low attendance rules

Staff attendance separated

⚠️ Risk Area

Multiple classes scheduled at same time (old system issue)

Your FRD already says:

“System must block scheduling conflicts”

👍 Good — but we must enforce this at timetable + attendance both.

🔒 Lock rule:

Attendance marking blocked if timetable conflict exists

MODULE 6: Lesson Planning ✅ (Very strong)

This is one of the best-designed modules.

What’s excellent

Planned vs actual separation

Deviation reasons

Auto-shifting future plans

HOD approval

NAAC alignment

No changes needed.
MODULE 7: Examination & Results ⚠️
What’s good

Component-based exams

Result lifecycle (Draft → Published)

Excel upload

Custom templates per program

⚠️ Decision Needed NOW

Grading vs Marks

Do PVGS programs:

Use pure marks?

Or grades (A/B/C)?

Recommendation:

System supports both

Configurable per program

Default = Marks

🔒 Must be decided before DB design

MODULE 8: Reports & NAAC ✅
What’s excellent

Report builder approach (future-proof)

NAAC-ready templates

Audit info on exports

Role-based visibility

No issues.
2️⃣ GLOBAL ISSUES & RISKS (IMPORTANT)
❗ Biggest Risk: Over-configurability

You’re building something very flexible.

That’s good — but:

🔒 Rule:

Super Admin only can change academic structure

Faculty/HOD never touch structure

❗ Data Migration Reality

You mentioned:

“Old system was barely used”

👉 Recommendation:

Migrate only students + fees

Ignore attendance, lesson plans, exams from old system

This avoids bad data poisoning.

3️⃣ DESIGN DECISIONS TO LOCK NOW 🔒

Before ERD, confirm these 6 decisions:

1️⃣ Default academic pattern = 2 semesters/year
2️⃣ Scholarships adjust future dues only
3️⃣ Manual promotion only in Phase 1
4️⃣ Both marks & grades supported (program-level)
5️⃣ No timetable conflicts allowed (hard block)
6️⃣ Super Admin only can change structure

👉 If you agree, we proceed.
If any point needs change, say which number.

4️⃣ READY TO PROCEED (NEXT STEPS)

Once you confirm, I will do in this exact order:

Step 1️⃣ ERD / Database Schema

Tables

Relationships

Keys

Audit fields

Step 2️⃣ Laravel Module Breakdown

Modules

Models

Services

Policies

Step 3️⃣ API & Service Layer Planning

Service responsibilities

Transaction boundaries

Validation layers

Step 4️⃣ Phase-1 Sprint Plan

Sprint 0 (setup)

Sprint 1–4 (features)

Team allocation (Laravel-only)

👉 ACTION REQUIRED FROM YOU

Please respond with either:

“All 6 decisions approved”
OR

List which decision numbers you want to modify

Once confirmed, we move to ERD design immediately.

2️⃣ Scholarships adjust future dues only
i am not sure , but i think the fee structure for scholarships is different , 
for example when student registration , 
he is asked if belogns to SC ST etc , 
if he is , and submits appropriate documents , then he can pay for that structure .

Great catch — and you’re absolutely right to question this.
What you described is not a “scholarship adjustment” model, it’s a separate fee structure model. That’s a very important distinction, and changing this now is the correct architectural move.

Let’s carefully revise the Fees FRD decision and lock the right model for PVGS.

🔁 REVISING DECISION #2 — FEES & SCHOLARSHIP MODEL
❌ What we previously assumed (generic model)

Scholarship = adjustment applied after fee assignment

This works for:

Private colleges

Merit-based scholarships

⚠️ But PVGS reality is different.

✅ What PVGS ACTUALLY DOES (based on your data)

From the old system screenshots and your explanation:

Student selects Category (SC / ST / OBC / OPEN / etc.)

Documents are uploaded

Fee amount itself is different

Separate fee rows exist like:

SY B.Sc CS

SY B.Sc CS Scholarship

FY M.Sc CS Scholarship

👉 This means:

Scholarship students are mapped to a different fee structure altogether

🟢 CORRECT DESIGN FOR PVGS (LOCK THIS)
🎯 Decision: Category-Based Fee Structures
Core Rule

Fees are NOT adjusted later

Fees are assigned correctly upfront based on:

Program

Academic Year

Category / Reservation

🧩 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ Fee Structure Creation (Accounts)

Accounts creates multiple fee structures for the same program/year:

Example:
SY B.Sc. Computer Science

General Fee Structure

SC/ST Fee Structure

OBC Fee Structure

EWS Fee Structure

Each structure has:

Its own total amount

Its own installment plan

2️⃣ Student Admission

During admission:

Student selects category

Uploads documents

Admin verifies category

System assigns the matching fee structure

✅ Student only ever sees their applicable fee

3️⃣ Installment Enforcement (Still Applies)

Even with category-based fees:

Installment order is enforced

Student cannot skip installments

This still fixes the original confusion

4️⃣ Category Change (Edge Case)

If:

Category documents are rejected

Or category changes

Then:

Admin can reassign fee structure

System recalculates dues

Previous payments are preserved

Action requires approval + audit

🔒 UPDATED & FINAL DECISION #2
✅ LOCKED DECISION

PVGS uses category-based fee structures, not post-assignment scholarship adjustments

This aligns with:

Your screenshots

Maharashtra government fee norms

Accounts workflow

NAAC reporting

🔁 UPDATED DECISION LIST (FINAL)

Let’s re-list and confirm all 6 locked decisions, updated correctly:

1️⃣ Default academic pattern = 2 semesters per year
2️⃣ Category-based fee structures (no post-fee scholarship adjustment) ✅
3️⃣ Manual promotion only in Phase 1
4️⃣ Both marks & grades supported (program-level)
5️⃣ No timetable conflicts allowed (hard block)
6️⃣ Super Admin only can change academic structure

✅ WHAT THIS UNLOCKS NOW

With this correction:

Fees ERD becomes much cleaner

No refund/adjustment complexity

Clear NAAC category-wise fee reporting

Accounts workflow matches reality

This was a critical clarification — well spotted.

👉 NEXT CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

Please respond with either:

“All 6 decisions approved”
OR

Mention if any other decision number needs change

Once confirmed, I will immediately proceed with:

➡️ ERD / Database Schema Design (PVGS-ready)

ok

Perfect 👍
I’ll treat “ok” as confirmation that all 6 decisions are approved and locked.

We now proceed in the correct engineering order, starting with the ERD / Database Schema design, fully aligned with everything we finalized.

🧱 STEP 1: ERD / DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN (PVGS)

I’ll present this in layers, so it’s easy for:

You to review

Laravel devs to implement

DB to scale later

I’ll avoid SQL for now and focus on entities + relationships.
